## 📍 Overview

The Walmart SalesBot and SearchGPT repository provides a machine learning solution to improve data analysis and search capabilities. The tool includes an AI chatbot, enabling users to interact with either the'WalmartBot' or'SearchGPT' bot in real-time. It utilizes a robust conversational AI agent that can fetch webpage content, gather weather details, conduct searches, and retrieve news. It provides a sales assistance system for Walmart, implementing stages of sales conversations and managing customer interactions. Additionally, the repository includes an API server for product search and information retrieval.

## 📦 Features

|    | Feature            | Description                                                                                                        |
|----|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⚙️ | **Architecture**   | The system is a conversational agent combining REST APIs, Search and Recommendation systems built with Python. It utilizes Python scripts, Jupyter Notebook, and Docker for deployment.|
| 📄 | **Documentation**  | The repository lacks a comprehensive README.md file, providing a detailed explanation of the system. Absence of inline comments make it hard to understand the modules' purpose.|
| 🔗 | **Dependencies**   | The system extensively relies on external libraries such as Pydantic, FAISS, OpenAI, Pinecone, DuckDuckGo, and much more for operating its functionalities.|
| 🧩 | **Modularity**     | The system is loosely coupled and separated into several scripts, each responsible for handling a certain aspect, making it adaptable, understandable, and maintainable.|
| 🧪 | **Testing**        | The system uses pytest as a testing framework but lacks any presence of dedicated test cases to validate its functionality.   |
| ⚡️ | **Performance**    | The system's performance heavily relies on the  efficiency of GPT AI model & Pinecone search engine, hence can be inferred to be performant. But it lacks performance testing or benchmarking.|
| 🔐 | **Security**       | There aren't any explicit security measures found. The system being API based, needs to ensure critical information is sanitized before processing. |
| 🔀 | **Version Control**| The repository lacks specific version control strategy as there's absence of branches, tags or even comprehensive commit messages. |
| 🔌 | **Integrations**   | The system integrates with various Python libraries, APIs, GPT AI model, and Walmart's product data, supporting the bot functionalities.|
| 📶 | **Scalability**    | The system is scalable due to its loosely coupled design that would support future enhancements, provided there is efficient error handling and architectural improvements. |

| [streamlit_interface.py](https://github.com/Shaon2221/Walmart-SalesBot-and-SearchGPT/blob/main/streamlit_interface.py)                                   | The code powers an AI chatbot web application with Streamlit. It allows users to choose between "WalmartBot" and "SearchGPT" bot types and interact with them real-time. It maintains a chat interface, showing recent user-bot conversations applying a dark or light theme based on user preference. Both types of bot responses are handled via POST requests to defined endpoints.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [search_capabilities.py](https://github.com/Shaon2221/Walmart-SalesBot-and-SearchGPT/blob/main/search_capabilities.py)                                   | The code implements a conversational AI agent in Python. It integrates third-party tools to fetch webpage content, gather weather details, conduct searches (via DuckDuckGo), and retrieve news. Besides, it specifies a set of behavior rules for the AI. The'get_response' function runs an input message through the AI agent, which interacts with tools based on its training and guidelines, getting necessary data, and returning a response. The system hides detailed error responses from users, replacing them with a generic misunderstanding message.                                                                                                                 |
| [csv_to_vectore_database(pinecone).ipynb](https://github.com/Shaon2221/Walmart-SalesBot-and-SearchGPT/blob/main/csv_to_vectore_database(pinecone).ipynb) | The code represents a part of a Jupyter notebook in the directory Walmart-SalesBot-and-SearchGPT. It attempts to install necessary dependencies such as protobuf, fastapi, uvicorn, langchain, openai, tiktoken, pinecone-client, and pinecone_datasets using pip. However, it encounters an error while attempting to install a specific version of pinecone_datasets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [run_api.py](https://github.com/Shaon2221/Walmart-SalesBot-and-SearchGPT/blob/main/run_api.py)                                                           | The code comprises an API for a Walmart Sales Bot, which searches for products and returns relevant information, and a Search AI, which fetches answers from sources like DuckDuckGo, Wikipedia, weather API, and Arxiv. The API employs FastAPI and pydantic models for request/response handling. Both services initialize a new conversation if no user inputs are present or continue pre-existing conversations. The bots respond with messages and potential sources of their responses. Errors raise an HTTP Exception.                                                                                                                                                     |
| [walmart_functions.py](https://github.com/Shaon2221/Walmart-SalesBot-and-SearchGPT/blob/main/walmart_functions.py)                                       | This complex Python script implements a sales assistance system for Walmart. The tool leverages OpenAI's GPT-4 model and Natural Language Understanding chains to guide sales conversations through different stages (Introduction, Product presentation, and Other queries) based on conversation history. It integrates with Pinecone to access a vector-based product database, offering product search and information retrieval for shaping responses. A custom class is designed to manage sales conversations, initiating conversations, determining next stages, handling customer input, and generating responses, optionally using a knowledge base for product queries. |
| [Dockerfile](https://github.com/Shaon2221/Walmart-SalesBot-and-SearchGPT/blob/main/Dockerfile)                                                           | The Dockerfile deploys a Python-based app for a Walmart sale-search bot through a Docker environment. It works by installing dependencies from requirements.txt, copying application files into the container, and running the application using the command'run_api.py' on port 4501. Other scripts in the repository appear to implement related functions like data conversion to vector format, search capabilities, and a Streamlit user interface.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Dependencies include openai and pytest for testing, faiss-cpu and pinecone-client for vector search indexing, black and flake8 for code formatting, Pydantic for data validation and settings management, and chromadb and xmltodict for handling data. Search results can be enhanced by duckduckgo-search, wikipedia and arxiv. The program includes an API server using uvicorn.                                                                                                                    |
